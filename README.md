# SLICE

**Turn any API description into an MCP server that exposes only the endpoints your AI agent is allowed to call.**

![Endpoint selection: tick what the agent may call](docs/screenshots/2-select.png)

## Overview

AI agents (Claude, Cursor, n8n…) reach external APIs through MCP connectors. Exposing a whole API to an agent
grants it too much power and floods its context: an agent that only reads orders has no reason to be able to
delete them. Existing generators target developers (CLI, config files).

SLICE is a web service: upload an API description, tick the endpoints the agent may call, and get a connector.
Anything left unticked does not exist for the agent.

| Upload | Configure |
|---|---|
| ![Upload an API description](docs/screenshots/1-upload.png) | ![Name, upstream auth and hosting, with the context saved](docs/screenshots/3-configure.png) |

## Features

- **Least privilege by construction** — the generated server exposes the selected endpoints only.
- **Three input formats**, detected automatically:

  | Format | Versions | Handling |
  |---|---|---|
  | OpenAPI | 3.0, 3.1 | Used as is |
  | Swagger | 2.0 | Converted to OpenAPI 3.0 |
  | Postman Collection | v2.x | Converted to OpenAPI 3.0 |

- **Two delivery modes** — download the generated TypeScript server, or use a hosted URL to paste into the agent.
- **Upstream authentication** — OAuth2 client credentials, bearer token, API key. In hosted mode the user's token
  is relayed, never stored.
- **Works with any MCP client** — stdio and Streamable HTTP transports.

## Getting started

Requires Node.js 22+ and pnpm 9+. No API key needed.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/cedricgicquiaud/slice.git
cd slice && pnpm install
pnpm dev        # http://localhost:5173
```

`pnpm test` runs the test suite; `pnpm build && pnpm start` runs the production build.

A single Express server serves the React UI and the API. Generated servers are rendered from Handlebars templates on
top of `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk`.

    D --> E{Delivery}
    E -->|download| F[Ready-to-run kit<br/>TypeScript + Docker]
    E -->|hosted| G[Hosted MCP URL<br/>token relayed, never stored]
```

Key decisions:
- **Isolated parsing.** Some specs exhaust memory. Parsing runs in a child process with a timeout, a memory cap and
  a concurrency limit: a malicious spec returns a clean error and the server stays up.
- **Server-side re-parse.** The server never trusts the parsed spec sent back by the browser; it re-parses the raw
  spec and filters the selection against its own result.
- **Hosted mode over a desktop binary.** The first plan shipped an executable; unsigned binaries are blocked by
  macOS Gatekeeper. The hosted mode serves several agent sessions in parallel instead.
- **External data is JSON-encoded in generated code.** Rule adopted after a review found two code-injection paths
  (token URL, OAuth scopes), both fixed.

## Status

Functional, not yet deployed.

- 556 automated tests, strict typing, CI on every pull request.
- 500 real public API descriptions run through the pipeline: 412 converted, 83 rejected cleanly, 5 too large,
  0 crashes (`corpus` workflow, on demand).
- Verified end to end in Claude Desktop against the Notion API.

Next: public hosted instance.
